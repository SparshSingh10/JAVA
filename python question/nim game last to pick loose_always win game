 The user has to pick less than 5 balls from the basket at a time.
 Each user will be given his/her turn alternately.
 The user who picks the last ball will lose the game.
 The first turn is of the user.
 The computer shall always win'''

for j in range (b,0,-1):
    if (b==1):
        print('You picked the last ball :) You Loose !')
        break
    n=int(input('pick the balls\n'))
    b=b-n
    print(f'balls left {b}\n')
    for i in range (b,0,-1):
        if (i-1)%5==0:
            cpu=b-i
            print('cpu took ',cpu)
            b=b-cpu
